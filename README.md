# Language Chain Information Retrieval
This repository contains code for performing information retrieval using language chains. The language chain framework allows for efficient retrieval of relevant information from a large corpus of documents.

# Description
The code in this repository demonstrates how to use the language chain framework to retrieve relevant information based on user queries. It utilizes the following components:

**langchain**: A library for building and using language chains. <br>
**VectorDBQA**: A question answering model that uses vector embeddings.<br>
**OpenAI**: A language model used for generating text.<br>
**RetrievalQA**: A retrieval-based question answering system using language chains.<br>
**OpenAIEmbeddings**: Embeddings module for OpenAI language model.<br>
**Chroma**: A vector store implementation for storing document embeddings.<br>
**CharacterTextSplitter**: A text splitter module for splitting documents into smaller pieces.<br>
**TextLoader**: A document loader for loading text documents.<br>
**chromadb**: A database for storing document embeddings.<br>
**tiktoken**: A library for tokenizing text.<br>
**nltk**: The Natural Language Toolkit for natural language processing tasks.<br>
